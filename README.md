## Motivation

For some reason [Lutim](https://github.com/ldidry/lutim) in non Perl equivalents are insanely hard to find.

This project does not aim to be as feature complete as [Pictshare](https://github.com/HaschekSolutions/pictshare), but to offer a simple web UI and some kind of backend storage.
